                <h4></h4>
                <p>Robotos is a collection of algorithmically generated droid characters designed by Pablo Stanley and minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation of 10,000 droids will be constructed from various metal outfits, tin faces, digital accessories, top pieces, faces, backpacks, arms, and colors. Robotos have different body types, some rarer than others, and... there are rumors that you could find humans pretending to be robots too. Is it true? ðŸ¤”</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The Robotos team are <span> Meela</span>, <span>Lulu</span>, <span>Zackboto</span>, <span>Niklas</span>, <span>Bureboto</span>, <span>Ireboto</span>, <span>Captain Excellent</span>Captain Excellent, <span>Jaboto</span>, <span>Darude</span>, the <span>Bueno Team</span>, and <span>Pablo Stanley.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Lulu</span> and <span> Meela</span> have led the community, events, partnerships, and marketing efforts. <span>Zack</span> built the algorithmic image previewer and editor, as well as the unique web3 experiences like the banner editor, your stuff page, the suit-up tool, the Robotos Workshop, and the Robopets Smart Contract.</p>
                    <p><span>Jaboto</span> and <span>Bueno</span> joined, helping with the gaming and world-building tools. <span>Niklas</span> has led the Discord management, bots, security, and adventures. <span>Bureboto</span> and <span>Captain Excellent</span> have expanded the art and world of Robotos and added their unique design vision to the project.</p>
                    <p>Other people who have helped throughout Roboto's history include <span>Ashira</span>, <span>Damn Randy</span>, <span> Melissa Mimosa</span>, <span>Caveguy</span>, <span>Viri</span>,<span>Ireboto</span>, <span>Waldo</span>, <span>Foodmasku</span>, <span>Tony Herrera</span>, <span> Clorxo</span>, and <span> Darude</span>. And we couldn't be anywhere without the help of our distinguished mods, <span>POLG</span>, Cool Kevin, <span>LeBoto James</span>,  <span>Saint</span>, Doomboto, and Dimps.</p>
                    <p>Pablo Stanley created Robotos, including all the art and story, and has led the project ever since. He's also a cofounder of Bueno and Humankind. He's previously contributed to the design community with open-source illustrations like Open Peeps, Humaaans, Avataaars, Buttts, Bottts, and Open Doodles. He's also the creator of The Design Team comics series.</p>
                    <p>In 2021, Pablo Stanley, Zackboto, and @guiltyNFT co-founded Robotos.</p>
                    <p>Pabs has shared free crash courses on different art and design tools on his YouTube channel, Sketch Together. And he's created some fun (and some dumb) projects like Clubpad, Pablito Planeta, Latinx Who Design, and Dreamer Stories.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to also follow Humankind, another project made by Pablo, Meela, & the Bueno team.</p>
